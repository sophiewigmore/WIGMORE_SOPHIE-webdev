# CS 5610: Web Development

My name is Sophie Wigmore, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at Northeastern. I am a combined Biology and Computer Science major. I am currently taking summer classes, and I just finished up my first co-op at ERT, in Charlestown, MA.

The purpose of this repository is for the Web Development course I am taking.
